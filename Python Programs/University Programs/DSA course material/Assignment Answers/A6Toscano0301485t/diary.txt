First implementing openFile which will open a file, read numbers from the file and insert them into a list.
- Opening a file
- Create a list to add values from file to
- Return list
- Add error handling
- Add a loop to keep asking if error is caught.

For heapify
Checking for condition if each individual element is a heap and the largest element is the parent
Start from the last element
Check if the left or right node is greater and swap accordingly.
Also have to check before hand if the left and right node exist

Parent node will be set to last element set to moved element and keep checking
No swaps then decrementing index

Fixing minor errors
Testing the code

Implementing a display function for display the heap list

Copy pasting part of the heapify function into the pushdown function

Implementing getmax
Will check if list is empty else will return the first element

Implementing removemax
Will check for empty list. Pop the first element and call pushdown

14th November
Testing all cases
Found errors in push down.
Adding a while loop in push down

Forgot to add the last element of the list to the top of the list in the removemax function.

Implementing bubble up
Create loop that will run till it reaches the root.
Setting parent root to index - 1 // 2
Compare the node to the parent node repeat till no swaps were made
If no swaps break
