To make running this program easier, there is an executable file in the dist folder.
Once you click on the dist folder you will be required to enter an API key. ( Over here we assume that the user has their own API key )
Copy the key and paste it in when prompted.

Need to knows:
Everything else should work as expected. 
-GPT might act up every now and then just keep re-clicking the submit button and it should work. (This is pretty common with 4o-mini but should be unlikely with 4o)(can be changed in the code if it absolutely refuses.)
-If you review the python file there are some extra lines of code here and there. We kept to add extra functionality in the future.

Future plans might add before presentation if possible(these features should not effect the basic use case of the program and are additional nice to have features):
-Total time taken value at the end of the quiz
-Score board for previous games (plan to hold at least 5) 
-Want to add an option for choosing between multiple AIs. Add the options to choose between chatgpt, gemini and perplexity. 
-Dynamic screen adjustment (since we are using place I think should be possible but we use grid and pack here and there so will require a redesign if we do move forward but should fix the bug issue we are having) 

All these options can be implemented but we will try to get atleast 1 of them done before the presentation and final submission.

Bugs we found and will try to fix.
- The text sometimes is bigger than the box. We have 2 options here to fix it (One tell chatgpt to generate the quiz with a character limit)(Two reduce the text size problem with this is it makes it very hard to view)
we will fix this for the final submission as we are trying to find other ways.
